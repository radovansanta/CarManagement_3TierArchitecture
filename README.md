# About the project
The project is an example of a 3-Tier distributed system communicating through REST-APIs. The first and the second tier are programmed in C#, however, the server in the third tier is developed in Java with a connection to SQL database.

* Tier 1 - C#
* Tier 2 - C#
* Tier 3 - Java
* Database - PostgreSQL<br/><br/>

# Project functionality
The user is able to create a new car by filling in its information (license plate, brand, model, horsepower) and store it in the database. All the process is realized through 3 tiers and the communication is done by REST-APIs as it's shown in the image below. <br/><br/>
